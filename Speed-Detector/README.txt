1. Project Title
Speed Detector Code Challenge

2. Project Description
This project is a simple speed detector. 
The speed detector allows the user to input a speed value, and based on that value, it calculates the number of demerits that should be assigned to the user's license. 
The project also determines whether the user's license should be suspended based on the number of demerits assigned. 

Technologies:
HTML: provides the basic structure of the web page.
CSS: provides the styling of the web page.
JavaScript: provides the functionality of the web page.
